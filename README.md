# Task 3 â€“ Interactive Dashboard Using Dash (Python)

This repository contains the solution for **Task 3** of the CodTech Data Analysis Internship. The goal is to build an interactive dashboard using the **Dash framework** in Python to visualize a dataset and provide actionable insights.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The dashboard presents an interactive scatter plot built with **Plotly** and **Dash**, visualizing:
- **GDP per capita** vs **Life expectancy**
- Grouped by **continent**
- Bubble size based on **population**
- Dataset: Gapminder (2007 snapshot)

Users can visually analyze which continents or countries have higher GDP and life expectancy, with interactive hover, zoom, and filter features.
